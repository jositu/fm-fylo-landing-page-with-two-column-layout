## My process

<!-- ~2 days, ~20 hrs~ -->

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) - For social media icons
- [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - To render CSS properties consistently for different browsers

### What I learned

This is one of the larger projects I've done so far. Most of the projects I have completed with Frontend Mentor consist of a single component, so one of the challenges I faced in this project was how to style multiple variations of the same component while minimizing redundancy in code. The thing I focused on the most while completing this project was keeping my CSS code organized.

### Continued development

Still need to complete the email validation styling. Also should reorganize CSS file to remove redundant code and group similar items together.

### Useful resources

- [White Fylo logo](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52829623/how-to-make-a-color-white-using-filter-property-in-css) - This helped me in changing the Fylo logo to an all white color for the footer. I was looking for different ways to create the necessary component using only CSS and the given svg file, and this was the simplest way I found.
<!-- - [Input Error](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/form-validation-styling-on-input-focus/) - I used this to figure out how to style and display an error message for the email inputs. -->
